== The Main View Menu

The main view menu presents the following options:

* <<load_project,Load existing project>>: allows the browsing of the filesystem to select an existing Geopaparazzi project file to load it
* <<create_new_project,Create new project>>: creates a new project on the sdcard. A timestamp based name is created by default but you can change it
* <<settings,Settings>>: shows the list of settings you can change
* <<main_advanced,Advanced>>: shows some advanced user options such as the application log or custom database queries
* <<Profiles, Profiles>>: allow creation and editing of Profiles.
* About: shows the about page, which contains info, links and acknowledgments
* <<exit,Exit>>: shuts down Geopaparazzi properly.  If you use the Android home button to exit, it will continue to work in background, draining the battery through GPS use.

=== Load an existing project
anchor:load_project[]

An existing project can be loaded using a simple file browser from within Geopaparazzi. The Geopaparazzi project files are shown with an icon to help the user to choose the proper file.


=== Create a new project
anchor:create_new_project[]

When a new project is created, you are prompted to give a file name
for the new project file. This is the name that will be given to the 
database file that contains all data collected in Geopaparazzi.

.The new project input dialog.
image::04_mapviewmenu/05_new_project.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once the name is defined, an new empty database is created and Geopaparazzi is 
restarted and opened loading the new created project.

=== Settings (ToDo)
anchor:main_settings[]

=== Advanced (ToDo)
anchor:main_advanced[]

=== Profiles
Profiles enable you to configure the Geopaparazzi environment by grouping specific basemaps, overlays, a notes form, and a project file into a Profile.  You can configure many different profiles and easily switch between them in Geopaparazzi.

==== Creating a Profile
To create a new profile simply push the orange button on the lower right of the view.

.An Empty Profile List
image::04_mapviewmenu/08_profiles.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once pushed, the main profile info dialog will pop-up. There you can insert a profile name and some description about the profile:

.Creating a Profile
image::04_mapviewmenu/09_profiles_new.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once OK is pressed, an empty profile is created:

.Profile List
image::04_mapviewmenu/09_profiles_new2.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The profile list gives information about its content, listing the number of basemaps, spatialite database overlays, Note forms, and project file.

From this view it is also possible to activate the profile through the switch at the bottom of the view.  Activating the Profile means the various files will be automatically attached to Geopaparazzi.  Since only one Profile can be active at a time, the activation of a Profile automatically disables the previously active Profile, if there had been one.

Once a Profile is active, in the Profiles view it is marked with two red lines in the top and bottom part of the Profile's card:

.An Active Profile
image::04_mapviewmenu/13_profiles_active.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

==== Deleting a Profile
Pressing the Profile's Trashcan icon will delete the Profile.  You will be prompted to make sure the Profile is not deleted by error:

.Deleting a Profile
image::04_mapviewmenu/10_profiles_delete.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

==== Styling a Profile
It is possible to apply a color to the Profile cardview.  Setting a color uniquely identifies a Profile  while running Geopaparazzi.  If a Profile has  aproject attached, you will know a particular Profile is active because it uses the color to set the background color in the Main View.

.Profile Style
image::04_mapviewmenu/11_profiles_color.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once you press "Set Properties", the profile list will appear with the new profile entry colored with the color you selected:

.Profile List
image::04_mapviewmenu/12_profiles_new.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

==== Adding data to a Profile
To add data to a profile, press the settings icon (gear-like icon in the upper right of the profile's cardview).

.Profile Settings
image::04_mapviewmenu/13_profiles_info.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The view the opens is divided in different tabs, namely:

* PROFILE INFO
* BASEMAPS
* SPATIALITE DATABASES
* FORMS
* PROJECT

===== Profile Info
The Profile Info tab shows the main information about the Profile:

* Profile Name
* Profile Description
* Creation Date
* Activate Profile

.A Profile's Information
image::04_mapviewmenu/13_profiles_info.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Name and description can be modified from this view, while the creation date is read-only.


===== Basemaps

The Basemaps tab allows you to add background basemaps to the Profile configuration. Currently supported extensions are:

* .map: mapsforge maps
* .mbtile
* .sqlite: sqlite databases containing rasterlite2 data
* .mapurl: mapurl files that can contain configurations for local or on-line (TMS or Google) mapping services.

Press the orange plus button on the top right part of the view to browse the device's filesystem and select the basemap files to add.

.A Basemap Added to a Profile
image::04_mapviewmenu/16_profiles_base.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

===== Spatialite Databases

The Spatialite Databases tab allows you to add Spatialite vector databases to the Profile configuration.

The database has to be a valid spatialite database with the extension sqlite.

Press the orange plus button on the top right part of the view to browse the device's filesystem and select the Spatialite databases to add.

.Adding a Spatialite Database

.A Spatialite Database Added to a Profile
image::04_mapviewmenu/17_profiles_spatial2.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]


===== Forms

The Forms tab allows you to add a JSON file of forms definitions to use in the Profile.

Once the file is added (through the upper right plus button), basic information and the names of the forms contained in the file are shown:

.A Form Added to a Profile
image::04_mapviewmenu/18_profiles_forms.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

===== Project

It is also possible to bind a single Geopaparazzi project file to a Profile. In that case, from within geopaparazzi it will no longer be possible to open an existing project or create a new one.

.A Project Added to a Profile

==== Importing, Exporting and Deleting Profiles

It is possible to import, export, and delete all Profiles. The menu available in the Profiles view allows access to:

* Import Profiles
* Export Profiles
* Delete all Profiles

.The Profile Menu
image::04_mapviewmenu/20_profiles_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

===== Export

When you press the Export Profiles menu entry, the Profile definitions are exported into a file in the path:

/STORAGE_PATH/geopaparazzi/profiles_config.json

.Exporting A Profile List
image::04_mapviewmenu/21_profiles_export.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

===== Import

When you press the Import Profiles menu entry, the Profile definitions are imported from the fixed file in the path:

/STORAGE_PATH/geopaparazzi/profiles_config.json

The imported profiles are added to the profiles already present in Geopaparazzi.

.Importing A Profile List
image::04_mapviewmenu/22_profiles_import.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

In order to support sharing of data and profile configurations, the path of the data contained in the imported files are adapted to the storage path of the current device. This way relative paths in the filesystem are maintained and datasets can be loaded.  In that case you download and import data that someone else prepared, but they will work in your device, even if the paths of the data refer to a different filesystem path.



=== Exit
anchor:exit[]

The exit button closes Geopaparazzi and stops any ongoing logging and sensor activity.

This might seem obvious, but it is important to note that this is the *only way to properly close Geopaparazzi*. Pushing the home button of the device will not close Geopaparazzi, which will continue any activity started. This is important, because it makes very long GPS loggings possible even if interrupted by phone calls or other uses of the device.

Often users that ignore this, after pushing the home screen and thinking that Geopaparazzi has been closed, experience a faster battery drop, because of the active application in the background.
