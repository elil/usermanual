The layers are rendered on the map starting with the top layer on the list, so basemap layers should be placed at the top of the list.

You can manipulate the layers by:

* Swiping to move between viewing the Map Layers list and the Project Layers list.
* Using the checkbox in the layer item to turn the layer off and on in the Map View.
* Doing a long press and drag a layer to move it in the ordered list.

===== Cloud Layers
Cloud layers are hard-coded layers referencing Cloud servers of mapping tiles.  To add a Cloud layer, select a layer from the menu, press OK.  If the Cloud server is available, the layer will be added.  After adding a Cloud layer, you can move it to be rendered first by long pressing the layer item and dragging it to the top of the list.

===== Local/Offline Layers
You can add Map Layers from a local data file.  This can be 

* Mapsforge files (.map)
* Spatialite files (.sqlite)
* mapurl files (.mapurl), with type=google and type=tms only; type=wms is not supported
* mbtiles (.mbtiles), raster only; vector is not currently supported

Selecting a Spatialite file will display a list of spatial tables in the Spatialite database; each one you select will be a separate layer.
