=== HM installation

You can download the latest Hortonmachine standalone version from https://github.com/TheHortonMachine/hortonmachine/releases[the releases site].

To install just:

* unzip the **hortonmachine.zip** archive
* launch the executables of the module of choice

TIP: Depending on the PC's power, the application can take a little moment to startup. 
If it doesn't, for windows OS, run the **hm-**MODULENAME**.bat**. It will give information
about the problems occurring helping to solve them. One common issue might for example 
be that the RAM memory given to the module is larger than the one available on the pc.

=== The data used

The data used in the following chapters https://github.com/geopaparazzi/usermanual/blob/master/userguide/11_hortonmachine/workshop_dataset.tar.gz[can be found here].

You should find in there:

* **roi.shp**: to define the region of interest
* **buildings_roi.shp**: polygons of buildings 
* **roads_roi.shp**: lines of the road network
* **pois_roi.shp**: points of interest
* **ortophoto_bucharest_georef.tif**: aerial image of the region

=== Create an MBTiles database

We wan to create an MBTile database with multiple styled layere:

image::11_hortonmachine/vienna_mbtiles.png[]

==== Styling

An MBTiles database can be created with various applications (gdal, QGis, Tilemill...). In the Hortonmachine we have
a dedicated module that generates mbtiles datasets from layers of raster and vector data.

To prepare the mbtiles dataset it is first necessary to style the shapefiles in order to get 
the right colors and labelings. Styling can be done following the OGC SLD 1.0 specification.
It is an open standard for styling data, so any compatible tool can be used. 

In the Hortonmachine we havethe following module to style data: **sld.exe** (hm-sld.sh for unix based systems).

Once launched, the following appears: 

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/01_main.png[]

===== Styling the buildings

Pushing the button with the 3 dots allows to select the shapefile that we want to style. 
Once loaded it will show the default style (or load it from an *.sld file, if available):

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/02_buildings_open.png[width=70%]

Play with the colors to get a white transparent background and a gray border.

Remeber to push **Apply** to view the changes.

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/03_buildings_style.png[width=80%]

Once the preview looks as desired, push the save button to write the style to the sld 
file near the shapefile.

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/04_sld_xml.png[]

===== Styling the roads

Styling roads is not much different from styling polygons. But in this case we also want 
a label applied to the road to see the name. To do so add a textsymbolizer by right clicking 
on the rule:

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/05_roads_textadd.png[width=70%]

Then, to begin, choose:

* the shapefile field to use for the label (name)
* a font (size more or less 36)
* a white halo (size 2)

Apply and see if you like it. 

Most probably you also want the labels to follow the line (set to true) and
give a bit of perpendicular offset so that the label is not on the road.

The result might look like:

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/06_roads_text.png[width=70%]

Again push the save button to persist the style.


===== Styling the pois

Points can be styled the same way as the polygons and lines. The only difference is in the 
possibility to select a mark to represent the points:

image::11_hortonmachine/sld/07_pois.png[width=70%]


==== A quick note on filters

We can slightly change the style of the buildings shapefile in order to better 
see the university buildings. To do so we can right click on any attribute (type
seems to be reasonable) and visualise the stats of that field. The result is a
table containing all values and their count:

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/07_building_sld.png[width=60%]

This gives us all the information to set the filter on a second rule that can be added by right
clicking on the parent node of the rules (in this case _name_):

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/08_uni.png[width=70%]


==== The MBTiles Creator

To create an mbtiles database from a set of data we can use the modules of the 
spatial toolbox. Launch **spatialtoolbox.exe** to open it:

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/01_st.png[width=60%]

The spatial toolbox contains many modules to do hydro-geomophological analyses, process 
LiDAR data and work with raster and vector data. In this course we will only use the 
part related to the **Mobile** category.

Before we run any module, make sure some settings are properly configured:

1. enable the checkbox that allows loading of experimental modules
2. set the Heap memory properly depending on your PC's RAM 

The **GeopaparazziMapsCreator** module is the actual module that creates the mbtiles database.

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/02_creator.png[width=70%]

The first set of parameters are:

* the shapefile of the area of interest we want to cover (roi.shp)
* the background raster file (aerial image tiff)
* the overlay shapefiles (buildings, roads, pois)

Once inserted, it should look like:

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/03_creator1_filled.png[width=90%]

The second set of parameters are:

* a name for the dataset (the db will be named like that also)
* the min and max zoomlevel. The max zoomlevel is important, since it defines 
  how large the dataset will get. On the given area a max zoomlevel of 19 
  is a good compromise. The zoomlevel is the one seen in geopaparazzi.
* the used image format. In case of aerial imagery, jpg is preferred.
* the output folder

Once inserted, it should look like:

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/03_creator2_filled.png[width=90%]

To finally generate the mbtiles database, push the run button on the upper right corner.
A console will appear showing the current status:

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/04_execute.png[width=70%]


=== Create a spatialite database

The **GeopaparazziSpatialiteCreator** allows to convert a folder of shapefiles into
a spatialite database that contains the layers styled following the 
supplied SLD.

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/05_spatialite_creator.png[width=70%]

The only input parameters to set are the:

* new spatialite database we want to create: **.../dataset/bucharest.sqlite**
* the folder of shapefiles to convert: **.../dataset/shps/**

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/06_spatialite_creator_filled.png[width=60%]

Then just run the module:

image::11_hortonmachine/spatialtoolbox/09_execute.png[width=70%]




=== Create a form

Geopaparazzi supports **complex notes** called form based notes.
To use them, a **tags.json** file needs to be created and **placed inside
the geopaparazzi folder** inside the sdcard. In that file a json
format description of the wanted tags and forms needs to be
placed.

By default, to help the user to start, a sample tags.json is created
in the Geopaparazzi installation. It contains form samples and
examples to show all supported form widgets.

==== The example form

Let's create a form to survey university buildings. It will be made up of 3 tabs. 

The general tab:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/00_form_general.png[]

The structural tab:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/00_form_structural.png[]
 
And the images tab:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/00_form_images.png[]


==== The gform module

The Hortonmachine has a module called **gforms.exe** that allows users to create
forms easily. 

Once opened it appears like this:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/01_open.png[width=60%]

===== Create a new form

To create a new form push the **new** button and name a new file. If the name
doesn't finish by **_tags.json**, the application will take care of adding it.

So inserting just **buldings**, will produce a file **buildings_tags.json**.

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/02_new.png[width=80%]

===== Create a section

Before doing anything, a **section** needs to be created. The section 
is what in geopaparazzi will be seen as a **button**.

Push the **add** button to the left of the combobox to add a new section:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/03_section.png[width=40%]

Enter a name and push **ok**. **buildings** might be a good name.

The combobox that had been empty up to now should now contain the buildings
section.

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/04_buildings_combo.png[width=80%]

With the **del** button it  is possible to delete an existing section. For safety
the user will be prompted to make sure the section should be removed.

===== Create a tab

To create a tab the **add** button at the bottom right has to be used.
The same as for the section, a name for the tab is prompted. 

We are first creating the **General** tab, so:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/05_new_tab.png[width=40%]

Let's add also the **Structural** and **Images** tabs. The result should 
look like:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/06_tabs.png[width=80%]

While the currently selected tab can be removed (**del** button below the **add** button) 
and new ones can be added, mind that at the time they can't be reordered: 
_new tabs are attached to the end_.

===== Create widgets

Once a tab has been created, widgets can be added to it. Widgets can be of various
types. The combobox at the bottom of the window contains all supported:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/07_widget_list.png[width=80%]

===== Add a textfield (to function as a label)

First we want to add a textfield that should also **act as label**, i.e. if populated
it should be visible near the point in the map view. It would be a good idea also 
to make it **mandatory**, i.e. the user won't be able to save the note without 
filling it out.

Select **string** from the widgets combobox and fill in the necessary parameters.

* **key**: the unique key of the field. It has to be unique in the whole section. 
  This is then used as column name for the shapefiles.
* **label**: the label presented to the user in the form.
* **default**: an optional default value to insert.

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/08_string.png[width=40%]

Once pushed **ok**, the form should look like:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/09_string_added.png[width=80%]

Note that in the label part, after an arrow, information 
about it being in label mode and/or mandatory, is given.

===== Delete a widget

If something went wrong and we need to remove a widget from the
current tab, use the second combobox at the bottom left of the **del** button.

That combobox is constantly updated with the keys of the widgets currently 
present in the tab. Selecting the righ key and pushing **del** 
allows us to remove a widget. Again, as for tabs, remember that
you can remove widgets in the middle, but *new widgets are added to the bottom*.


**Please now add a textfield for the faculty field.** 

In this case a default value might be a good idea.

===== Add a checkbox

To add a checkbox, select the **boolean** widget. 

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/10_checkbox.png[width=40%]

After which we should see something like:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/11_general_tab.png[width=80%]

===== Add a combobox

The last widget of the **General** tab is the number of enrolled students.

**stringcombo** is the choice for this:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/12_combo.png[width=40%]

While we have already seen key, label and defaultvalue, the items 
textarea is new. In there we can place the values we want to see in the
combobox, one per line:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/13_combo_filled.png[width=35%]

TIP: The default value has to be exactly the same as one of the items.

After adding the combobox, our form should now look like this:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/14_general_tab_done.png[width=80%]

Once the structural tab is done it should look like:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/15_structural_done.png[width=80%]

and the images tab:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/16_images_done.png[width=80%]

TIP: the form is auto saving: all changes are automatically registered on the output file.

===== See the form in Geopaparazzi

To test the form inside Geopaparazzi, it is necessary to upload the form file
to the device and place it inside the folder **geopaparazzi** at the root of the 
sdcard.

Any file ending with *_tags.json will be loaded in the geopaparazzi notes view.

So if we added our new form file, we should get the following:

image::11_hortonmachine/forms/17_buildings_gpap.png[width=40%]

Note that only the **Buildings** button comes from the form file we added,
the others are from the default **tags.json** that is available from the
beginning in geopaparazzi.

==== Notes about forms

* a form is persisted in geopaparazzi with its whole definition. So a note 
  can be edited also when the original form is no longer available
* a few widgets, namely connectedcombo and onetomulticombo are not yet supported
  in the gforms application, but can be created manually
* a multistringcombo allows for multiple selection
* forms are editable, simple notes not
