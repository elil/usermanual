In the GPS preferences it is possible to 

* define the time interval for taking a point when in logging mode.  This is the primary filter for location.
* define the minimum distance in meters, the current GPS location must be from the previous GPS saved point before it is added to the GPS log. This is useful for example in the case in which the user stops moving during logging and the GPS continues to supply points.  This is a secondary filter to prevent the addition of points with the same location to the GPS log.
* have the Map View re-centered on the GPS position when the position 
  reaches the screen border (useful while driving)
* use network based position instead of GPS position. This can be useful 
  for testing purposes. The network based position is by no means precise!


=== SMS Settings

Geopaparzzi listens to incoming short messages containing the word:

    GEOPAP

If such a message comes in, Geopaparazzi instructs the phone to answer with an SMS to the incoming
number by sending the last known position.

Insert the panic numbers(s), i.e. the numbers to which a status update is sent when 
the panic button on the Main View is pressed.
