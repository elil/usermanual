In the Map View you can create, view, and edit the attributes of point, line and polygon features held in a Spatialite database.  You cannot edit the geometry of existing features.  You cannot edit geographic features in a Basemap.  Editing a Project's Notes, Bookmarks, and GPS logs are covered elsewhere in this manual.

If you need to create a Spatialite database, press the Import button on the Main View dashboard, and press <<Default databases, Default Database>> (take note of the file name of your new database).

You can use your existing Spatialite databases by attaching them to the Map View by using the Map View menu item <<Spatialite data list, Spatialite data list>>.


=== Viewing Feature Attributes

After adding a Spatialite database in the Map View Layers dialog, turn on the viewing of layers by checking the box next to the layer name.

Back on the Map View, you will see the features (you may need to pan and zoom to them).  To view the attribute values of features, press the Edit Tool button (it looks like a pencil) on the lower right of the Map View.  That will cause the Feature Select button to appear on the lower left.  

.Feature Select Tool

Press the Select button then press and drag on the Map View to make a box surrounding the features you are interested in.  

.Selecting a Feature

WARNING: To exit the Map View the Edit Tool button must be un-selected.

If there are any features in the box a Features dialog will appear showing the attribute names and values.  If you've selected more than one feature, you can show their attributes by swiping on the Features dialog.

If there are any resource files (for example, images, PDFs ) associated with the feature, a camera icon will appear in the left of the Features Action Bar.  Pressing on the camera icon will show a list of resources.  

[[Feature_Resources]]

=== Editing Features

In addition to just viewing the features, you can edit the attribute values of features stored in a Spatialite database or add geometry and attributes of new features.

==== Select a Layer for Editing

To edit, add a Spatialite database in the Map View and turn on the layer for viewing and enable the layer for editing. Return to the Map View to start editing features.
