== The Main View

Once you launch Geopaparazzi, the dashboard appears in the Main View.

All the features that need to be quickly accessed, such as toggling GPS on and off, 
creating a note, as well as visualizing the current position 
on a map, are accessible from the dashboard.

.The dashboard of geopaparazzi.

From the dashboard the following primary functions can be accessed:

* the action bar functions
* take notes
* view or modify the project metadata
* create a GPS Track
* switch to Map View
* import Data
* export Data

=== Action Bar
anchor:action_bar[]

The action bar at the top of the Main View, from right to left, presents the following functions:

* the main menu
* the GPS status (via an external application, https://github.com/barbeau/gpstest[GPSTest]) button
* the GPS information button

The GPS information button shows a summary of current GPS data. If the GPS has acquired a fix, information about the position is given: 

.Information shown when tapping the info button.

The icon of the GPS status button can be of the following colors:

* RED:  GPS is not switched on
* ORANGE: GPS is on but no fix was acquired
* GREEN: GPS is on and has fix, but no log is being recorded
* BLUE: GPS is logging.


=== The panic button

At the bottom of the view the orange **Panic Button** is visible when a GPS location is available. Once pushed it 
leads to the *panic!* view, which presents two buttons:

* the *PANIC!* button
* the *just send position* button

.The panic panel.
image::02_dashboard/20_panic.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The panic button sends a request for help SMS with the last available GPS
position to a phone number that can be configured in the <<settings>> of geopaparazzi.

If no number is configured, the system SMS dialog opens up with a precompiled message
and the user will have to select the contact to which to send the message:

.The system SMS dialog
image::02_dashboard/21_panic_sms.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The _just send position_ button opens up the SMS dialog directly filling in the position without any request for help message. It is meant for quick sending the current position via SMS so that it can be opened from Geopaparazzi.

=== The dashboard buttons

==== Notes

Geopaparazzi supports different types of notes:

* image notes
* sketch notes
* map notes
* text notes
* form-based notes (pick lists, etc.)

To access them you can tap on the first icon of the dashboard,
the *Add Notes* icon. Once you tap on it, the *Add Notes* dialog 
appears:

.Adding notes to the project.
image::02_dashboard/03_notes.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The switch button at the top of the view gives the possibility to
choose whether the note will be recorded with the **current GPS position** 
(in case GPS is on) or at the **current center of the Map View** (the crosshair).  If the current GPS position is not available, it will not be possible to move the slider to the gps position setting.

The *Return to view* checkbox returns you to the *Add Notes* screen after you finish your note.  If the box is not checked, you will be returned to the dashboard in the Main View.

At the right end of the actionbar are the quick note buttons. From left to right:

* The **Quick text note** button opens a simple dialog where a text note can be written. Want to save the note? 
  Tap on the *ok* button. Want to trash it? Tap on the *cancel* button.

NOTE: The position of the note is taken when the note view is opened, not closed, in order to have all the time needed to insert the text while moving. 

.The simple text note dialog.
image::02_dashboard/04_textnotes.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

* The **Quick picture note** button will launch the camera application 
  that comes with your android system which gives lots of
  possibilities of customization of the images size, focus and so on. 
  This has one drawback, which is the fact that we are not able to pick 
  the azimuth of the camera shot at the exact moment it is taken. 
  The azimuth is therefore recorded at the moment the camera application is closed.
  That means that to have a realistic azimuth, you need to take the picture 
  and stay with the device in the same position of the snapshot until 
  you have closed the camera app.

* The **Menu** button, which allows you to select **Simple Sketch** to draw on a small panel or select **Layout Settings** to change the layout Notes buttons and their text size.

.The notes menu.
image::02_dashboard/05_note_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Selecting **Simple Sketch**, you can change stroke style, color, and width. The  sketch panel comes from the open source app https://github.com/valerio-bozzolan/AcrylicPaint[Acrylic Paint].

NOTE: If your device has room in the Action Bar, for example holding your phone in landscape instead of portrait, the Simple Sketch icon will appear in the Action Bar and the Simple Sketch item will be removed from the menu.

WARNING: Once a simple note has been saved, it can't be modified.

Selecting **Layout Settings** allows you to change the text size on the Note buttons and the number of columns.  This can be useful to make the *Add Notes* screen easy to read while in the field.

===== Form based notes

Form based notes allow you to take complex notes containing detailed information.
Some example forms are included in the installation of geopaparazzi.

The **example** button in particular shows all the possible form widgets available:

.An example of form based notes.
image::02_dashboard/06_form_based_notes.png[scaledwidth=60%, width=60%]

The notes can be saved and modified at any time.

To understand how to create forms, have a look at the section dedicated to <<forms>>.

==== Project Info

The Project Info screen shows information about your current Geopaparazzi project database.

It shows:

* the database file name
* the project name
* the project description
* project notes
* creation and last closing dates
* the user that created the project
* the user that last modified the project

Apart from the dates, that are set by the system, all data can be changed and 
saved through the save button.

.The Project Info screen.
image::02_dashboard/07_project_info.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

It is also possible to add additional metadata to the project information. The plus button at the right side of the actionbar opens an input dialog that allows the user to define a key, a label and a value for the new metadata entry:

.The new metadata entry dialog.

==== GPS Logging

To start logging, the user simply has to push the **logging** button.

Once it is tapped, the user is prompted to insert a name for the 
log or to accept the one generated based on the current date and time
( log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS ).

It is also possible to attach the new log to the last created log by 
checking the box: *Continue last log*. In that case the proposed name 
of the log (or any user inserted) is ignored, since no new log is created. 

.The new GPS log dialog. From here you can continue the last log.
image::02_dashboard/08_start_logging.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once logging has started, the GPS logging button will turn orange and the GPS status icon blue.

To stop logging, the same button is used. Once tapped, you are prompted 
to verify the action. 


==== Map View
 
.The map view.
image::02_dashboard/12_map_view.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The Map View presents a map and a set of tools that can be used to navigate 
the map, make measurements, or edit datasets. The various tools are described 
in the section dedicated to the <<Map View>>.

==== Import

.The import view.
image::02_dashboard/13_import.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Geopaparazzi supports the import of:

* GPX datasets
* bookmarks
* default Spatialite database
* geopaparazzi cloud projects
* geopaparazzi Cloud Profiles


===== GPX

By tapping on the *GPX* icon, a simple file browser is shown to import your GPX file.

.The simple geopaparazzi file browser.
image::02_dashboard/16_import_gpx.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The browser only shows folders and files with gpx extensions. On selection, the 
file is imported into the current project.

===== Bookmarks

Bookmarks can be imported from csv files that *must be placed in the root of the sdcard* and the name of which has to start with the part **bookmarks** and to end with the extension **.csv**.

Geopaparazzi will let you select the files to import if more than one are available import only those that do not exist already.

The format of the csv is: **NAME, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE** as for example:

----------------------------------------------
Uscita Vicenza Est, 45.514237, 11.593432
Le Bistrot, 46.070037, 11.220296
Ciolda, 46.024756, 11.230184
Hotel Trieste, 45.642043,13.780791
Grassday Trieste,45.65844,13.79320
----------------------------------------------

===== Default databases

When tapping the default database import button, you are asked to name the new Spatialite 
database to create, with the default name based on the current date and time:

.Creating A Default Spatialite Database
image::02_dashboard/19_mapsforge.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The newly created database is **editing ready** and contains a layer of each type geometry type (points, lines, polygon). Since it is a template db, the attributes table have been created as generic fields with names from **field1 to field20**. It is very generic and simple, but still of use when you have to quickly draw some spatial data with attributes and have no database prepared.


===== Cloud Projects
Geopaparazzi Project files can be downloaded from a Geopaparazzi Project server.  To enable the import of projects from the Cloud, make sure you enter the settings in the <<Cloud Projects Sync Settings, Cloud Projects Sync Settings>>


===== Cloud Profiles
Profiles are a convenient way to group map layers, note forms, a project file, and other files.  Geopaparazzi Cloud Profiles must be downloaded from a Geopaparazzi Profile server (standard local <<Profiles, Profiles>> can be created on your device using the Profiles screen rom the main menu).  To enable the import of Profiles from the Cloud, make sure you enter the settings in the <<Cloud server Settings, Cloud server Settings>>.  

Once your Cloud server Settings are set, and you press the Cloud Profiles button on the Import view, the server will send a list of Profiles available for download.

.Cloud Profiles List
image::02_dashboard/22_import_profiles1.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

image::02_dashboard/package_download.png[float="left"]
Select a Profile for download by pressing on the icon of the Profile.  This will start the download of the Profile and the files associated with the Profile.  The download may take some time depending on the size of the files.

When the download is completed, you can activate the Profile by using the Profile view from the Main View menu, selecting the <<Adding data to a Profile, Profile Info>> tab, and sliding the Activate profile switch.



==== Export

.The export view.
image::02_dashboard/18_export.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Geopaparazzi supports the export to the following formats:

* KMZ
* GPX
* bookmarks
* images
* Project Forms to PDF
* geopaparazzi cloud projects
* geopaparazzi cloud profiles


===== KMZ

It is possible to export all collected data to KMZ format. 

KMZ is well known as it can be visualized in the 3D viewer http://earth.google.com/[Google Earth].

In the export:

* the notes are placed as red pins having the first letters of the text content as label
* the images are placed as yellow pins
* the GPS logs are visualized as tracks

===== GPX

The lines and notes data are exported to GPX, creating tracks and waypoints.


===== Bookmarks

Bookmarks can be exported to a csv file that has to be called *bookmarks.csv* and 
are placed in the root of the sdcard.

Geopaparazzi will write to the file only those bookmarks that do not exist already in the csv. 

===== Images

Since images are kept inside the database, this export is handy if the user needs 
to use the images inside a different software. In this case all the images of the project are exported inside a folder and a popup message shows the folder path.

===== Project Forms to PDF

You can export your notes to a simple PDF document.  After pressing the "Project Forms to PDF" button you can select which notes you would like to include in the PDF file.  The PDF file created will be a the root of the device's file system and named "geopaparazzi_projectexport_" with a timestamp and a .pdf extension in the file name.
