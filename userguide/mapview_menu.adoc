Through geocoding it is possible to insert some address and find its location (uses Google Maps geocoding service) when your device has an active network connection.

From the same panel it is possible to create a route from the current position to the inserted location. 

The routing service used is http://project-osrm.org/[OSRM].

Once the Routing button is tapped, the route is calculated by the service
starting from the current map center to the destination point.
The route is then downloaded, inserted into the project as a new GPS log, and shown as a GPS log track.
