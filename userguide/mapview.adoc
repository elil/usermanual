== The Map View
anchor:mapview[]

The map view is the central view of the application. It can be used to view the current GPS position overlaid on maps and vector datasets.

The <<supported_datasets,supported datasets>> section lists and describes all supported map types. Just to cite a few, you can view:

* http://www.openstreetmap.org/[OpenStreetMap] raster tile maps both when on-line (downloading new tiles) and off-line (visualizing those that were cached during online mode)
* http://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/[raster mbtiles databases]
* local and remote http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification[TMS] tiles
* mapsforge vector files


=== Map View tools

The Map View has a set of tools that can be used to interact with the map. 

When first launched, the tools are already visible on the map. To have a cleaner Map View, you can long press on the upper right menu button to toggle the visibility of the tools.

=== Map navigation

The navigation of the map is probably the most basic and important part.

* **pan**: panning of the map, i.e. moving the map around is simply done
  by dragging the map with a finger. While panning, the current 
  longitude and latitude of the map center are displayed.
  
image::03_mapview/29_pan_coords.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

* **zoom**: zoom in and out can be done in different ways. There are 
  the zoom in/out buttons at the lower right part of the map. It is also
  possible to zoom in by double-tapping on the map. Zoom in and out can
  also be achived through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch[pinch-zoom gestures].
  
NOTE: If you have trouble reading small text on some basemaps, you can "magnify" the map display by doing a long press on the "zoom in" button.  You can magnify multiple times if needed.  Don't forget to demagnify (long press on the "zoom out" button) before you do other Map View operations such as measure or feature ID.

* **center on GPS**: through the lower center button it is possible 
  to center the map on the GPS position. The button also shows the status of the GPS the same way as the icon <<action_bar,on the main view's action bar>>.

=== Add Notes

.Add notes.

The Add Notes button opens the same notes view as the button on the dashboard.  For further information about taking notes, visit the <<Notes, notes section>>.

=== The Notes List

A long press on the Notes icon will show the Notes List.  The notes list shows all the available notes, both text and image notes.

.The notes list view.
image::03_mapview/03_noteslist1.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The icon on the right side of the actionbar allows the user to sort the notes by different modes:

* *None*: insertion order
* *By Name* and inverse: sorts the notes by their name
* *By Map center distance* and inverse: sorts the notes by the distance from the current map center position

.The notes sort order dialog.
image::03_mapview/04_noteslist_sortorder.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

In the upper part of the view there is a textbox that helps to filter particular notes based on  name.

.Notes can be filtered by text.
image::03_mapview/04_noteslist_filter.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]


At the right side of the list two icons are available. The left one positions the map on the selected note's position while the right one opens a menu:

.The note menu.
image::03_mapview/05_note_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

From the note menu the user is able to:

* edit notes
* share the note through social networks
* delete the note
* use the current note as a filter. All notes with the same name will be visible.
* access the submenu related to all notes

.The submenu that considers all notes.
image::03_mapview/07_notes_all_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

From the all-notes submenu the user can:
 
  - select all notes
  - invert the current selection
  - delete the selected notes

The pallet icon on the Notes List view allows you to change the graphic properties of the notes.

.The Notes Properties.

=== Add Bookmark

Bookmarks are in a layer on their own. They contain saved extent settings of the current map view.
When a bookmark is added, the user is prompted to insert a name for the bookmark
or leave the generated name based on the current time and date.

.The add bookmark dialog.
image::03_mapview/08_add_bookmark.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

When a bookmark is added, a small star is added on the map in the center of the screen.

Since the map bounds and zoom are saved, you can return to the view 
that the bookmark represents in any moment.

It is possible to tap on the bookmark to read its label.

.A tapped bookmark.

=== The Bookmarks List

The bookmarks list shows all the saved bookmarks in the project.

In the upper part there is a textbox that helps to filter particular bookmarks based on name.

Other operations on individual bookmarks are access by pressing bookmark's icons:

* go to the bookmark location (left icon)
* edit the bookmark
* delete the bookmark

=== GPS log analysis tool

The log analysis tool allows to analyze the various positions of a GPS log.

Once enabled, you can simply touch (and hold) the screen near a GPS log and information about 
the nearest log point will be shown. Also the color of the text will be the one of 
the currently queried log:

=== GPS Data List

The GPS Data list is accessed by using a long press on the GPS Log button.  The list shows the data surveyed, both points and tracks.

.The GPS data view.
image::03_mapview/14_gpsdatalist.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

In the action bar there are possibilities to _select all_, _unselect all_ and _merge selected logs_. 

The **list of GPS logs** gives the possibility to customize the display of the logs. It is possible to change the visibility of the log using the checkbox. The icon on the right side of each entry opens the GPS log properties panel:

.The GPS log properties panel.
image::03_mapview/16_log_properties.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

From the properties panel it is possible to:

* change the name of the GPS log
* check the start and end date and time
* update and read the log track length
* enter the log track style panel to change stroke and fill
* zoom to the first or last point of the log track in the map view
* chart the log track. The chart has two axes, speed [km/h] on the left and elevation [m.s.l.] on the right.

* remove the track

=== Measure tool

Activating the measure tool disables the ability to pan the map while enabling the possibility to draw a path on the map and measure the path drawn. 

The *approximate* (the distance is calculated without considering elevation deltas and with the coordinate picking precision of a finger on a screen) distance is shown in the upper part of the map view.

When active, the measure tool has a orange colored icon, when inactive the icon is green instead.

=== Battery Status Indicator

The Batter Status Indicator shows the percentage charge of your device's battery.


=== GPS Position Button

If you tap the GSP Position button, the Map View will center the map on the current GPS position.

A long press on the button will display the GPS options.
