== Using form based notes

Geopaparazzi supports collecting complex notes called *form based notes*. To use them, you need to create a **tags.json** file and place it inside the geopaparazzi folder. That file contains a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[json format] of your forms.  Geopaparazzi will use that form definition to render a form in Geopaparazzi allowing the user to take specific Notes.  Those Notes are saved in the Geopaparazzi project file in the notes table.

By default, to help the user to start, a sample tags.json is created in the Geopaparazzi installation. It contains form samples and examples to show all supported form widgets.

Currently no tool is available to create forms in an interactive way, they have to be created manually in a text editor. 

A good online tool to at least validate your json tags file is the http://www.jsonlint.com/[Json Lint Validator]. Make sure it passes that test before putting it on the device and test it in Geopaparazzi.

=== Supported tags (via the example form)

The example form that is available by default shows all the possible options available.

==== Text

[source,json]
----
      "formname": "text",
      "formitems": [
          {
              "key": "some text",
              "value": "",
              "type": "string"
          }
      ]
----

==== Multiple Text

[source,json]
----
      "formname": "multiple text",
      "formitems": [
          {
              "key": "some text",
              "value": "text1; text2; text3",
              "type": "dynamicstring"
          }
      ]
----

==== Text with key and label

In simple forms the key element is also used as form label text for the widget (ex. *some text* in the text note). Some character sets are not suitable to be used as keys for a database, so in that cases the user should consider to define both the key (ex. in English) and the label (in the own language). Here an example:

[source,json]
----
"formname": "text example with key and label",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "the_key_used_to_index",
        "label": "the label used to describe",
        "value": "",
        "type": "string"
    }
]
----

image::08_forms/03_text_key.png[scaledwidth=70%, width=70%]


==== Numbers

[source,json]
----
"formname": "numeric text",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "a number",
        "value": "",
        "type": "double"
    },{
        "key": "an integer number",
        "value": "",
        "type": "integer"
    }
]
----

image::08_forms/04_numeric.png[scaledwidth=70%, width=70%]

To use one of the values as a map label in the map view add the *islabel* tag:
[source,java]
----
"formname": "numeric text used as label in map",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "a number",
        "value": "",
        "islabel": "true",
        "type": "double"
    },{
        "key": "an integer number",
        "value": "",
        "type": "integer"
    }
]
----


==== Date

[source,json]
----
"formname": "date",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "a date",
        "value": "",
        "type": "date"
    }
]
----

image::08_forms/05_date.png[scaledwidth=70%, width=70%]

==== Time

[source,json]
----
"formname": "time",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "a time",
        "value": "",
        "type": "time"
    }
]
----

image::08_forms/06_time.png[scaledwidth=70%, width=70%]

==== Labels
A formitem with a of type = label is useful for showing some extra text on your form.  It has no input field.

[source,json]
----
"formname": "labels",
"formitems": [
    {
        "value": "a simple label of size 20",
        "size": "20",
        "type": "label"
    },{
        "value": "a underlined label of size 24",
        "size": "24",
        "type": "labelwithline"
    },{
        "value": "a label with link to the geopaparazzi homepage",
        "url": "http://www.geopaparazzi.eu",
        "size": "20",
        "type": "labelwithline"
    }
]
----

[source,json]
----
"formname": "boolean",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "a boolean choice",
        "value": "",

    }
]
----

==== Combos
Combos are useful for having the user select from a fixed set of preset values.  There are different types of combos:
* stringcombo - select a single value
* multistringcombo - select one or more values


[source,json]
----
"formname": "combos",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "a single choice combo",
        "values": {

    {
        "key": "a picture archive",
        "value": "",

    {
        "key": "a sketches archive",

==== Map screenshot

[source,json]
----
"formname": "map",
"formitems": [
    {
        "key": "an image of the last seen map",
        "value": "",
        "type": "map"
    }
]
----

=== Other supported tags

==== hidden 

Not shown in the gui, but useful for the application to fill in info like the GPS position:

[source,json]
----
    {"key":"LONGITUDE", "value":"", "type":"hidden"}
----

==== primary_key 

An item of particular importance, can be used by the application to link to particular info:

[source,json]
----
    {"key":"tourism", "value":"", "type":"primary_key"}
----

==== Constraints

Constraints are conditions that are checked when the OK button of the form is pushed.

===== mandatory

To make an item mandatory, just add:

[source,json]
----
    "mandatory": "yes"
----

===== range

To peform a range check on a numeric field you can add something like:

[source,json]
----
    "range":"[0,10)"
----

which would check that the inserted number is between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).


=== Create a simple form to map fountains

As an exercise we will now create a simple form to map fountains.

==== Sections

Every form is composed of sections, each of which create a button in the add notes view.
We want to create a form for a fountain, so one section is enough. The blueprint for such a form, i.e. the empty button shell starts with:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "sectionname": "fountain",
        "sectiondescription": "fountain",
        "forms": [
----

and ends with:

[source,json]
----
        ]
    }
]
----

==== Form subsections

Each section can contain several sub-forms, that will create a tab each.

A sub-form starts with:

[source,json]
----
            {
                "formname": "General data",
                "formitems": [
----

and ends with:

[source,json]
----
                ]
            },
----

Note that the comma at the end is only needed if more than one sub-form
is added.

==== Form elements

To add content to the sub-forms, any of the tags described <<tags,in the supported tags section>> can be used.

For example lets add two text fields to prompt the user for a name and street. Also the name should then be the label rendered in the map view.

[source,json]
----
                    {
                        "key": "name",
                        "value": "",
                        "islabel": "true",
                        "type": "string",
                        "mandatory": "yes"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "street",
                        "value": "",
                        "type": "string",
                        "mandatory": "no"
                    }
----

==== Finalize the form

This is everything that needs to be done. Let's also add some technical data in a dedicated tab and also a tab for media, inside which it is possible to take pictures.

We leave the exercise to the reader.

The complete tags.json file can be found in the <<appendix,appendix section>>.
